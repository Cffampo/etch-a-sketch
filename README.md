# Etch-A-Sketch 🎨

A fun and interactive digital version of the classic Etch-A-Sketch! This project allows users to draw on a grid by hovering their cursor, with each cell changing to a random color.

## Technologies & Implementation 💡  

### **HTML: Structuring the Page**  
HTML provides the foundational structure of your application. Key elements in your project:  
- **Semantic HTML (`<button>`, `<div>`)**: Ensures clarity in your code for accessibility and SEO.  
- **Grid Container (`<div class="container">`)**: Holds the dynamic drawing area where users interact.  
- **External Resources (`<script>` and `<link>`)**: Efficiently loads JavaScript and CSS to keep HTML clean.  

### **CSS: Styling & Layout**  
CSS transforms the structure into an engaging visual experience.  
- **Flexbox (`display: flex`)**: Centers elements dynamically for responsive design.  
- **Grid System (`flex-wrap: wrap`)**: Ensures smooth layout of the sketching area.  
- **Transitions & Hover Effects (`#btn:hover`)**: Adds interactivity to buttons.  
- **Box Shadows & Borders (`box-shadow, border-radius`)**: Provides a sleek modern UI feel.  

### **JavaScript: Dynamic Functionality**  
JavaScript is where the magic happens—bringing interaction to the project.  
- **Event Listeners (`mouseover`, `click`)**: Captures user interactions smoothly.  
- **DOM Manipulation (`document.createElement`, `appendChild`)**: Builds a dynamic grid with customizable sizes.  
- **Random Color Generation (`Math.random()`)**: Creates unique, engaging user experiences.  
- **User Input Handling (`prompt`, `alert`)**: Ensures validation before modifying the grid.  

## **Future Improvements 🚀**  
- Add an eraser feature  
- Introduce different brush styles  
- Save the artwork as an image
